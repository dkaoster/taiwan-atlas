# Taiwan Atlas TopoJSON

Similar to the [topojson/us-atlas](https://github.com/topojson/us-atlas) project, this repository provides a topojson redistribution of the shapefiles provided by Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior. See [the demo](https://observablehq.com/@dkaoster/taiwan-map) for usage example.

All of these files are provided at a scale of 1:10 thousand.

A [TopoJSON file](https://github.com/topojson/topojson-specification/blob/master/README.md#21-topology-objects) containing the geometry collections <i>villages</i>, <i>towns</i>, <i>counties</i>, and <i>nation</i>. The geometry is quantized and simplified, but not projected. This topology is derived from the Ministry of the Interior’s [村里界圖(TWD97經緯度)](https://data.gov.tw/dataset/7438). The town boundaries are computed by [merging](https://github.com/topojson/topojson-client/blob/master/README.md#merge) villages, the county boundaries by merging towns, and the nation boundary is computed by merging counties, ensuring a consistent topology.

## MercatorTw Projection

`mercatorTw.js` uses a Taiwan-centric composite projection of four [d3.geoMercator](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo#geoMercator) projections: One for the main island, and one for each of Penghu, Kinmen, Lienchiang, and Wuqiu respectively.

This package exports the mercatorTw projection and can be used in your own projects.

```js
import mercatorTw from 'taiwan-atlas';
```
